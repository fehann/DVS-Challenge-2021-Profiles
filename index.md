## About

This is an entry for the [State of the Data Visualization Industry 2021 Challenge](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/soti-challenge-2021) based on the annual survey results.  This is an explanatory data visualization to understand the shift in profiles of data visualization professionals, how they are changing roles and making the entire industry move.

Most aggregated data does not allow us to deep dive into the nuances of different profiles in the data visualization community. With this in mind, the idea of using glyph provides the combination of roles for the main profiles in the industry. This type of representation can create chaos at first but also provides the possibility to further explore the landscape. While creating the visualization, by noticing that around half of the profiles were the same (the person had only the role of “Position in an organization with some data viz job responsibilities”) it was possible to remove half of the chaos out of the visual and focus on the more unknown profiles.
